# Klicker Electro
A recreation of Flash game series Klicker Klacker from King.com/Royalgames, the likes of Klicker Fusion and Klick Klack & Turn, with its own distinct theme. Original games are taken down from the site, but are available in Flashpoint.

Click on groups of same-colored cubes to clear them. Clear as much of the board as you can. Bomb cubes activate on the bottom and can then be clicked to clear the cubes next to it. Fill up the blast meter to clear a column of your choice. Radioactive cubes double the points you get for the match. Complete 3 levels with increasingly large game boards.

Uses Pygame and Tkinter

```
pip install pygame
